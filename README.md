# multiTrans
Translation tool for English, Chinese, French, German and Spanish using Google Translate API  
  
Language: HTML, CSS, PHP  
  
# Why?  
Because Google Translate doesn't support translation for more than two languages at the same time. It is troublesome for me because when I learn German, French and Spanish, I sometimes need translation from both English and Chinese.  
  
# How to use it?  
Simply type any of the 5 languages and web page will return the translation for the other 4 languages.

# Side note:  
There are many other files that belong to this project but I did not upload them because they concern credentials of my Google Cloud account.  
  
Thank you for browsing my project. Hope every multilingual speaker can find/build his/her favorite translation tool :)
